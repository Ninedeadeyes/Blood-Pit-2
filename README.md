My version contain additional features such as 

1) My own artwork and music  
2) 'Death Grip' feature =  Build up 'rage' by your normal attack to deliver a deadly attack
3) "Focus" feature = "Miss a turn to penetrate the armour of your enemies in the next turn. 
4) Ending with ending music
5) You are able to see the power level of the next attack from the enemy hence providing a purpose for 'defend '  
6) General Refactoring using Implemented Arrow Functions and Ternary Operator to reduce code size and implemented
OOP (Class) for enemy objects
